# Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website
## Project Objective:
In this project, I built a rugby club group page that is able to dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen. This project demonstrates many of the responsive design tools and techniques that I have learnt so far in the Codecademy: Full Stack Dev Course.
## Project Requirements
<ul>
    <li>Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of <code>width</code> after a certain minimum screen size</li>
    <li>Using a <code>@media</code>> rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.</li>
    <li>Employing responsive units <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> to size and space elements with <code>width</code> and <code>padding</code>.</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
