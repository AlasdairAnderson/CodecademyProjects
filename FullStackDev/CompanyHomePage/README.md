# Chellenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

## Overview
In this project, I use flexbox to design and build the layout of a company's home page

### Project Requirements
I am to build an hompage for a real or imagined company. The content that should be on the home page should at leat include:

- A title and logo or splash image
- A mission statement or brief description of the company.
- A list or set of images andtitles represneting the product or products of the company.
- A section describing some of the company's employees or teammates.

I should use flexbox styleing for the layout. Aiming to use flexbox's advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible elements flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.

The page should also use custom styles for other properites, such as colors, fonts, and otehr layout properties such as borders and padding.
